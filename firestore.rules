/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for BoardPrep Pro.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for all data stored
 * under `/users/{userId}`. Users can only read and write their own data.
 * Read access to `/questions` and `/quizzes` is public.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: User profiles and settings.
 * - /questions/{questionId}: Question bank for quizzes.
 * - /quizzes/{quizId}: Quiz definitions.
 * - /users/{userId}/quizAttempts/{quizAttemptId}: User's quiz attempt history.
 * - /users/{userId}/attemptedQuestions/{attemptedQuestionId}: User's attempted questions.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only access their own user document and associated subcollections.
 * - Listing the /users collection is denied to prevent information disclosure.
 * - Questions and Quizzes are public and readable by anyone.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 *  None. The user id is encoded in the path.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * Private user data is stored in subcollections under `/users/{userId}`,
 * while public question and quiz data resides in top-level collections.
