/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for BoardPrep Pro.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for all data stored
 * under `/users/{userId}`. Public read access is granted to the `/questions`
 * and `/quizzes` collections. No user data is listable.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: User profiles and settings.
 * - /questions/{questionId}: Questions for the board exam.
 * - /quizzes/{quizId}: Quiz definitions.
 * - /users/{userId}/quizAttempts/{quizAttemptId}: Quiz attempts by users.
 * - /users/{userId}/attemptedQuestions/{attemptedQuestionId}: User-attempted questions.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only read and write their own data under `/users/{userId}`.
 * - Listing of users is disallowed to prevent data scraping.
 * - Questions and quizzes are publicly readable.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 *  N/A - All authorization is based on path ownership, so denormalization is not required.
