/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules for BoardPrep Pro.
 *
 * @core_philosophy This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for personal data,
 * while allowing public read access to shared resources like questions and quizzes.
 *
 * @data_structure
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profiles.
 * - /questions/{questionId}: Stores question data.
 * - /quizzes/{quizId}: Stores quiz definitions.
 * - /users/{userId}/quizAttempts/{quizAttemptId}: Stores individual user quiz attempts.
 * - /users/{userId}/attemptedQuestions/{attemptedQuestionId}: Stores user-specific question attempts.
 *
 * @key_security_decisions
 * - User data is strictly controlled by the user; only the authenticated user can read/write their profile and associated data.
 * - Listing of all users is denied to prevent information leakage.
 * - Questions and Quizzes are considered public and can be read by anyone.
 *
 * @denormalization_for_authorization  Path-based authorization is used extensively for user-owned resources, avoiding the need for `get()` calls within security rules.
 * @structural_segregation Public data (questions, quizzes) and private data (user profiles, attempts) are stored in separate top-level collections to simplify rules and enhance security.
