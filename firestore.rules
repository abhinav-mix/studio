/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules for BoardPrep Pro
 * @corePhilosophy This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for personal data and allows public read access to questions and quizzes.
 * @dataStructure
 *   - /users/{userId}: Stores user profiles. Accessible only to the user and potentially admins (not yet implemented).
 *   - /questions/{questionId}: Stores questions. Publicly readable.
 *   - /quizzes/{quizId}: Stores quizzes. Publicly readable.
 *   - /users/{userId}/quizAttempts/{quizAttemptId}: Stores quiz attempts. Accessible only to the user.
 *   - /users/{userId}/attemptedQuestions/{attemptedQuestionId}: Stores attempted questions. Accessible only to the user.
 * @keySecurityDecisions
 *   - User listing is explicitly denied to prevent unauthorized data access.
 *   - Public read access to questions and quizzes simplifies data retrieval for all users.
 *   - All write operations on user-owned data require authentication and ownership validation.
 * @denormalizationForAuthorization N/A
 * @structuralSegregation Public data (questions, quizzes) are stored in top-level collections, while private user data (profiles, attempts) are stored under /users/{userId}.
