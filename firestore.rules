/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for BoardPrep Pro.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user profiles, quiz attempts, and attempted questions,
 * while providing public read access to questions and quizzes.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profiles, accessible only to the user themselves.
 * - /questions/{questionId}: Stores question data, publicly readable.
 * - /quizzes/{quizId}: Stores quiz definitions, publicly readable.
 * - /users/{userId}/quizAttempts/{quizAttemptId}: Stores quiz attempts, accessible only to the user who made them.
 * - /users/{userId}/attemptedQuestions/{attemptedQuestionId}: Stores attempted questions, accessible only to the user who attempted them.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User data and quiz attempts are secured using path-based ownership, ensuring that only the authenticated user
 *   can access their own data.
 * - Questions and quizzes are considered public data and are readable by anyone.
 * - Listing of quiz attempts and attempted questions is restricted to the owner of the userId.
